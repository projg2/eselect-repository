# The following variables can be used below to reference paths
# configured at build time:
#   CACHEDIR -- system cache directory (e.g. /var/cache)
#   SYSCONFDIR -- system configuration directory (e.g. /etc)
#   SHAREDSTATEDIR -- system shared state directory (e.g. /var)

# Location of the repository configuration file or directory. If it is
# a directory, Portage rules for subfiles are used.
REPOS_CONF=${SYSCONFDIR}/portage/repos.conf

# File to use for newly added repositories when REPOS_CONF is
# a directory.  You can use "${repository}" to refer to the name
# of repository being added.
REPOS_CONF_SUBFILE=${REPOS_CONF}/eselect-repo.conf

# Top directory to keep newly added repositores in. New repositories
# will be added with subdirectories following repository names.
REPOS_BASE=${SHAREDSTATEDIR}/db/repos

# Location of the remote repository list. The default is to use
# the gentoo-mirror list that contains pregenerated metadata cache.
REMOTE_LIST_URI=https://qa-reports.gentoo.org/output/repos/repositories.xml

# Alternative: original Gentoo list.
#REMOTE_LIST_URI=https://api.gentoo.org/overlays/repositories.xml

# Directory to store repositories.xml cache. The file will always
# be called "repositories.xml" due to technical limitations of wget.
REMOTE_LIST_CACHEDIR=~/.cache/eselect-repo

# Interval (in seconds) to check the remote repository list for changes.
# The default is 2 hours.
